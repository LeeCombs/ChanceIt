# ChanceIt

Old group project of a networked, dice-rolling game with four contributors.

Roll some dice, then roll more to build up score. If you roll your initial roll again however, you lose it all!

Aim to have the highest score over 20? rounds.

Play against 4 'advanced' AI, locally, or over a network which is not supported anymore!
